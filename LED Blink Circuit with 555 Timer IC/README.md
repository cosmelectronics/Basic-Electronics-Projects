## Introduction
The **555 Timer IC** is one of the most popular integrated circuits used for timing, pulse generation, and oscillation.  
In this project, we configure it in **astable mode**, where the output continuously toggles between HIGH and LOW, causing the LED to blink.  

By changing the capacitor or resistor values, you can adjust the blink speed.

## Connections
- **Power:** Pin 8 â†’ +9V, Pin 1 â†’ GND  
- **Output:** Pin 3 â†’ LED â†’ Resistor (330 Î©) â†’ GND  
- **Timing Components:**  
  - Pin 7 â†’ Resistor (10 kÎ©) â†’ VCC  
  - Pin 7 â†’ Resistor (1 kÎ©) â†’ Pin 6 & Pin 2  
  - Pin 6 & Pin 2 â†’ Capacitor (10 ÂµF) â†’ GND  
- **Control:** Pin 4 â†’ VCC  

---

## Working Principle
- The capacitor charges and discharges through resistors, generating a square wave at the output.  
- The LED connected at the output pin blinks ON and OFF automatically.  
- The blink speed depends on **R1, R2, and C** values.  

**Formula for Time Period (T):**  
T = 0.693 Ã— (R1 + 2R2) Ã— C  

---

## Testing
1. Power the circuit with a 9V battery.  
2. Observe the LED blinking automatically.  
3. Adjust capacitor value to change blinking speed.  

---

## Troubleshooting
- **LED not blinking:** Check capacitor polarity and resistor connections.  
- **LED always ON:** Ensure reset pin (Pin 4) is tied to VCC.  
- **Very fast/slow blink:** Adjust capacitor (10 ÂµF â†’ slower, 1 ÂµF â†’ faster).  

---

## Example Output Behavior
- At power ON â†’ LED starts blinking.  
- ON â†’ OFF â†’ ON â†’ OFF â€¦ continuously.
